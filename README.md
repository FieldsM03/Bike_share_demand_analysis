# DSA 587 – Internship Project
**Author:** Mitchell Fields  
**Program:** M.S. Data Science & Analytics – SUNY Buffalo State University  

## 🧭 Overview
This repository showcases my internship project for **DSA 587**, focused on applying data analytics techniques in a professional environment.  
The internship involved working with real-world datasets to support data-driven decision making, improve reporting efficiency, and design solutions aligned with business goals.

## 🧰 Responsibilities
- Collected, cleaned, and analyzed operational data using Python and SQL.  
- Built automated reports and dashboards to visualize key performance metrics.  
- Collaborated with team members to identify process inefficiencies and propose data-backed improvements.  
- Documented all analysis steps, models, and findings for internal use.

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **SQL:** data extraction and cleaning  
- **Excel:** quick analysis and validation  
- **Git / GitHub:** version control and documentation  

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Improved data reporting turnaround time by [insert measurable % or hours if known].  
- Identified [insert example insight, e.g., “underperforming process areas based on workflow data”].  
- Delivered a final presentation summarizing insights and recommendations.  

## 📂 Files
